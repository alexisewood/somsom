    <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
    <p>This is a map which gives the locations of a few endangered plants located on UC Berkeleyâ€™s campus. This data was taken from the crowdsourcing program <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Lab One Questions:</h2>
    <p><b>1. Explain the key decisions youâ€™ve made regarding the design and content of your page...</b></p>
    
    <p><b>2. What about from a web browserâ€™s perspective...</b></p>
    
    <p><b>3. Why bother to make your own web map with a platform like Leaflet instead...</b></p>
